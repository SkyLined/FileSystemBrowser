This repository contains Python scripts that can be used to create a webpage
from a directory tree. The webpage shows a tree structure similar to Windows
Explorer when opened in a webbrowser. Text based files such as HTML, Markdown,
and txt files can be viewed online while other file formats can be downloaded.

The script can serve the webpage directly from a built in webserver or write
the relevant files to disk. These files can then be served from a different
webserver to show the tree.
